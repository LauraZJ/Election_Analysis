# Election_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to analyze the election results for three counties in a precinct.  To do this, we used Python to read and analyze the data in a CSV file and then print the results in a git bash terminal and write the results to a .txt file.

# Election Audit Results

## Total Votes
Total votes cast in this election:  369,711
    
To obtain the total votes, we first set the total_votes to 0 (not pictured below) and then used a for loop to go through each row and add each vote to the number of total_votes.
